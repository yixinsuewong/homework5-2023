Style the links so that they have the same color even after they have been visited.*/

a:link, a:visited {
    color: blue;
}

/*Step#6 
Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  
The required styling is the following: 
background: #288088,
solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners.

You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width. */

    border: 10px solid #50C7C7; /* Solid 10px border with color */
    margin: 10px; /* 10px margin on all sides */
    width: 300px; /* Set the width to 300px */
}

/*step#10 Edit the css for the gallery class to use flex to match our example. (You may want to look at the screen shots from 1200px and 1500px as well -  the changes are not from media queries, but from the use of flex.)

    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row; /*set up direction*/
